# Introduction

A lightweight Python wrapper for the `systemctl` command, designed for use in Python-based service managers, admin tools, and dashboards.

---

# Features

* Query service status, PID, and enable status
* Start, stop, and restart services
* Enable and disable services
* Structured output, clean API
* Parses and interprets `systemctl` output

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** All `systemctl` operations except for `sysemctl status` require root access. This module uses `sudo` to deal with this fact. It's recommended that you use a fine-grained sudo configuration. For example, the following two lines in the `/etc/sudoers` file allow the *sally* user to start and stop the *db4e* services **without prompting for a password** to make your Python project run smoothly.

```
sally ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl start db4e
sally ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl stop db4e
```

The above *sudo configuration* script that *sally* runs that uses this module will be successful in starting and stopping the *db4e* service, but will fail if `enable()` or `disable()` are attempted.

# Installation

```bash
pip install systemctl
```

Or clone locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NadimGhaznavi/systemctl
```

---

# Example Usage

```python
from systemctl.systemctl import systemctl

svc = systemctl('db4e')

if not svc.installed():
    print("Service not installed")
elif not svc.active():
    print("Service is stopped. Starting...")
    svc.start()
else:
    print(f"Service is running with PID {svc.pid()}")
```

---

# Methods

```python
svc.start()          # Start service
svc.stop()           # Stop service
svc.restart()        # Restart service
svc.enable()         # Enable service startup at boot time
svc.disable()        # Disable service startup at boot time
sve.service_name()   # Get/Set the service name
svc.running()        # Check if the service is running
svc.enabled()        # Check if the service is enabled
svc.installed()      # Check if the service is present
svc.pid()            # The PID of the running process
svc.stdout()         # Raw systemctl stdout from systemctl
svc.stderr()         # Raw systemctl stderr from systemctl
svc.timeout()        # Set the timeout value for systemctl
```
